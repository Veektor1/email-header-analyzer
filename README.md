## How to Use

1. Copy the full email header from any suspicious email and paste it into a file named `sample-header.txt`.
2. Run the Python script using the command:

   python analyzer.py

3. Review the output in the terminal to see any warnings or anomalies.

## Example Output

- SPF or DKIM failure warnings
- Mail servers the email passed through
